# Microbit Presentation


### Introduction

The Microbit is a microcontroller created by the BBC in a continuing trend to bring younger generations into the world of programming and IOT.  And to that end, I think the makers of the Microbit did a fantastic job:
* The device is fitted with a number of onboard sensors, buttons, leds, and more.  
* The libraries available for the Microbit's programming are incredibly easy to work with.  
* The power consumption is incredibly low compared to a pi or arduino
* Numerous programming languages are available for the microbit
